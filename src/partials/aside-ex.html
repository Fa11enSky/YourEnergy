      A lot of times I find that people who are blessed with the most talent
      don't ever develop that attitude, and the ones who aren't blessed in that
      way are the most competitive and have the biggest heart.

        The World Health Organization recommends at least 150 minutes of
        moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity throughout the week for
        adults aged 18-64. However, what happens if we adjust that number to 110
        minutes every day? While it might seem like a high number to hit,
        dedicating 110 minutes daily to sporting activities may offer
        unparalleled benefits to physical health, mental well-being, and overall
        quality of life.
